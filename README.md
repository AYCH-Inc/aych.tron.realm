Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables - checkout [realm.io](https://realm.io). 

This repository holds the source code for the core database component used by all the Realm Mobile Database products:
realm-java, realm-cocoa, realm-js and realm-dotnet. Realm Core is not in itself an "end-user" product with a publicly stable and supported API (yet). It is the intention to build a publicly supported C++ API (see issue #), but that will be a separate product and likely build on top of realm-object-store.

## Building Realm

How to build Realm Core is described [here](how-to-build.md).
